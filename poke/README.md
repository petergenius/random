Pokemon™ FADB
=============

An FADB of all Pokemon™ created by fans.  

`bin/pokecreate` is code used to generate each pokemon's data

NOTE: This data was generated from `pokeapi.co`

All the data is most recent. Generation means generation **introduced**. If new stats or ability changes came later, then that pokemon has them. For example, abilities weren't introduced until `Generation 3`, yet some `Generation 1` pokemon have them, becuase they were updated from later generations.
